## Projects

### MangoVison
Developed an AI-driven solution to automate garment classification and attribute extraction for fashion designers and photographers. Utilized fine-tuned CLIP embeddings, cosine similarity, and machine learning to cluster similar garments and assign attributes via a majority voting system. Created a Streamlit interactive prototype to streamline fashion data management and enhance workflow automation.  
**Technologies:** AI, CLIP, Streamlit, Python, Machine Learning
